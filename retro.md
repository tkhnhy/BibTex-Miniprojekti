Sprint 1:

Using Glad, Sad, Mad method.

Glad:
- Backlogs in a good format and easy to see progress.
- Finished everything we planned and configuration is mostly done.

Sad:
- Version control is somewhat messy, because everyone is doing their own thing.
- Broken code in main branch.
- Although we had agreed on who should do the presentation,
weed to test the app is working before customer meeting,
and that all recent commits are pulled.
- Didn't have a common vision for the front-end UI.

Mad:
- Some of us had a busy week, not much time and energy.
- Some problems with using Telegram for team communication,
- should be sorted out now.
- Lost some time looking into Github Projects,
but it did not fit the course requirements.

Improvement measures:
- Agree on common rules for using version control.
- Having better communication, even on smaller things.


Sprint 2:

Using Glad, Sad, Mad method.

Sad:
- Tag story couldn't be finished
- Robot testing downloading is challenging
- Would be nice to make some more progress in the start of the sprint
- Robot have repetition and maybe theres a way to initialize them nicely

Mad:
- Week is busy, hard to find enough time to contribute much

Glad:
- Copilot review works nicely
- Git management was nice this time
- The application looks mostly nicely

Improvements:
- Make some more consistent progress, starting in the beginning of the sprint already
- Research robot test initialization
- Keep the communication up


Sprint 3:

Sad:
- Not enough tasks/features taken for the sprint for everyone
- Having trouble understanding the architecture of the project, making contribution harder
- A bit of overlap with multiple people working on a feature
- A user story was being bottlenecked by another user story being unfinished for most of the week
- Increase in code smell, when a new implementation is created, but old code is not removed

Mad:
- A member fell ill, another woke up with a headache.
- Product backlog accidentaly got deleted.

Glad:
- More work was achieved this sprint than previous sprints

Improvements:
- Maybe write some short documentation on the workings of the program, so everyone can get a clear understanding of how it works.
- While more work was done earlier in the week, some was still left to the last day.
- Communicate better, WHEN and what exactly each member is going to develop.
