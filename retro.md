Using Glad, Sad, Mad method.

Glad:
- Backlogs in a good format and easy to see progress.
- Finished everything we planned and configuration is mostly done.

Sad:
- Version control is somewhat messy, because everyone is doing their own thing.
- Broken code in main branch.
- Although we had agreed on who should do the presentation,
weed to test the app is working before customer meeting,
and that all recent commits are pulled.
- Didn't have a common vision for the front-end UI.

Mad:
- Some of us had a busy week, not much time and energy.
- Some problems with using Telegram for team communication,
- should be sorted out now.
- Lost some time looking into Github Projects,
but it did not fit the course requirements.

Improvement measures:
- Agree on common rules for using version control.
- Having better communication, even on smaller things.
